## Winter 2020


## Files Included

#### 1. knapsack-bu.py
#### 2. data.txt
#### 3. danielenv.yml


## Running the files 
#### First try:
#### 1. python3 knapsack-bu.py
#### (data.txt should be in the same folder as knapsack-bu.py)

**(Syntax is in python 3)


#### Dependency:  none
#### I've tried running on our OSU virtual environments by executing "python3 fileName"
#### I did not have any trouble or need to install packages. Hopefully that will be the same for you.
####  If you can't run the files with python3 file_name,
####  then please try to use my virtual environment file which will install the necessary packages.

## Activate Python Environment (Anaconda)
#### To activate an environment: 
### python conda activate danielenv.yml
##### This requires that you have anaconda installed.
