## Files Included

#### 1. badSort.py
#### 2. badSortTime.py
#### 3. Data.txt
#### 4. bad.out.txt
#### 5. danielenv.yml

## Running the files 
#### First try:
#### 1. python3 badSort.py
#### 2. python3 badSortTime.py
**(Syntax is in python 3)


#### 3* Dependency: NumPy Package 
#### I've tried running on our OSU virtual environments by executing "python3 fileName"
#### I did not have any trouble or need to install packages. Hopefully that will be the same for you.
####  If you can't run the files with python3 file_name,
####  then please try to use my virtual environment file which will install the necessary packages.

## Activate Python Environment (Anaconda)
#### To activate an environment: 
### python conda activate danielenv.yml
##### This requires that you have anaconda installed.
